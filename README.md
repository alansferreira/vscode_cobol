|--------|:---------------------:|
| ctrl+alt+p  | Goto procedure division |
| ctrl+alt+w  | Goto working-storage section |
| ctrl+alt+d  | Goto data division (or working-storage section if not present) |
| ctrl+alt+,  | Go backwards to next section/division |
| ctrl+alt+.  | Go forward to next next section/division |
| alt+c       | Move to copybook/file |

## Settings

- COBOL tab stops can be changed by editing the *coboleditor.tabstops* setting.
- Extensions used for *move to copybook*, can be changed by editting the *coboleditor.copybookexts* settings.
- Directories used for *move to copybook*, can be changed by editting the *coboleditor.copybookdirs* settings.

## Tasks

Visual Studio code can be setup to build your COBOL source code.

### Task to use MsBuild

MsBuild based projects can be consumed as build task, allowing navigation to error/warnings when they occur.

Below is an example of *build* task that uses *mycobolproject.sln*.

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [ {
            "label": "build",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "msbuild",
            "args": [
                "/property:GenerateFullPaths=true",
                "/t:build",
                "mycobolproject.sln"
            ],
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            },
            "presentation": {
                "reveal": "always"
            },
            "problemMatcher": "$msCompile"
        }
    ]

}
```

## Complementary extensions

### [ToDo tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) by Gruntfuggly

Although this extension does not understand comments in COBOL source files, it can be made to my adding the following user setting:

```json
{
    "todo-tree.flat": false,
    "todo-tree.expanded": true,

    "todo-tree.regex": "((//|#|<!--|;|/\\*|\\*>|^      \\*)\\s*($TAGS)|^\\s*- \\[ \\])",
    "todo-tree.tags": [
        "TODO",
        "FIXME",
        "!FIXME",
        "CHANGED",
        "BUG",
        "NOTE"
    ],
    "todo-tree.filterCaseSensitive": true,
    
    "todo-tree.iconColours": {
        "FIXME" : "#A188FF",
        "!FIXME" : "red",
        "NOTE" : "blue",
        "TODO" : "cyan",
        "CHANGED" : "yellow",
        "BUG" : "red"
    }
}
```
